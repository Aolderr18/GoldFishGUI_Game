# GoldFishGUI_Game
I designed a simple game where the user's character is a goldfish and their job is too match coins together. 

Rules:

-When the user touches a coin, it will show its color. Its color will go away when another coin is touched.
-If the user touches a coin, the user is expected to remember that coin's color
-If the user touches a coin and then touches another coin that they had previously touched, if they are the same color, the coins disappear. If they are not the same color, the user loses a life and the round starts over. 
-There are four coins to match up.
-The game has two rooms, there are six doors. Only one door is the "real" door. If the user touches the wrong door, then they lose a life and the round starts over.
-At the beginning of each round and when the user enters the other room, a message will appear with an arithmetic expression. Each door has a number on it. The correct door has the number equal to the arithmetic expression.
